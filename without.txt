1. News Fetching (XML Parser)

News Format: News will be fetched in XML format. You need a parser to extract the relevant information (e.g., title, body, publication date, source URL).

XML Parser: Use a popular XML parser like lxml or xml.etree.ElementTree in Python for robust XML parsing. Ensure it can handle malformed XML and other edge cases.

Drop Box: News will drop into a temporary storage box before processing. This allows for any necessary checks or delays before rephrasing and posting.

Temporary Storage: Store the news in a database or in-memory storage (like Redis), with a TTL (time-to-live) of 24 hours. After this period, it auto-clears from the database.

2. AI Rephrasing (Using Tiri API)

AI API Selection: Use the Tiri API for rephrasing, with the ability to retry another key if one fails (high availability). You will need 3 different Tiri API keys to ensure that if one fails, the other is used.

API Key Management: Store API keys securely using .env files (with libraries like python-dotenv) so that they are not directly exposed in the code.

Retry Mechanism: Implement an automatic retry mechanism for failed requests. You can implement exponential backoff to avoid bombarding the API with too many requests in case of errors.

3. Configurable Time & Delay Handling

Delay Between News: When multiple news stories arrive at once, implement a delay mechanism to control the rate at which news is sent for rephrasing. This can be a configurable delay between processing each item (in seconds).

Configurable Parameters: All time-related configurations (e.g., delay time, feed refresh time, and storage TTL) should be easily adjustable via a configuration file (e.g., config.yml or .env).

Max Delay Between News: Allow a configurable maximum delay between processing each news item in case of a burst of news drops.

4. Social Media Posting (Facebook)

Posting to Facebook: After rephrasing, post the news to Facebook. This can be done using the Facebook Graph API.

Allow configuration for adding more social media platforms in the future.

Make it easy to add multiple accounts or platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).

5. Error Handling & Recovery

Error Handling: Implement thorough error handling for every step of the process (fetching news, rephrasing, posting to Facebook). If one part fails, retry the operation and log the error.

Logging: Store logs for every step in a separate log file or send them to a monitoring service like Sentry, Loggly, etc.

Log Details: Log every step: fetching news, rephrasing success/failure, posting success/failure.

Logs should auto-clear after 24 hours, and this should be configurable.

6. Monitoring & Logging

Logging: Record logs for all operations and ensure that you capture detailed messages for debugging purposes.

Log Rotation & Deletion: After 24 hours, automatically clear logs to prevent data overload in your storage.

7. Database Management

Database: Use a simple database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MySQL) for storing the news items temporarily. Ensure it can scale and handle multiple feeds and API keys.

Auto-clear: Every 24 hours, clear news from the database to avoid overloading the storage.

Separation of Concerns: Separate the logic of fetching news, rephrasing, and posting to maintain modularity in your application.

8. Deployment & Flexibility

GitHub Deployment: You’ll push everything to GitHub. Afterward, you can deploy on an Ubuntu server.

Ubuntu Deployment Guide: Provide a detailed step-by-step guide starting from git clone to configuring the environment, installing dependencies, and setting up cron jobs for automation.

Multi-Platform: In the future, if you want to add more platforms, ensure that the architecture is flexible enough for someone else to add new agents or platforms with ease.

9. Configuration & Customization

Feed Customization: All news feeds will be configurable, and you can add or change feeds in the configuration files easily.

Platform Customization: Similarly, the social media platforms and accounts can be added or removed without code changes—just modify the config.

All Configurations in One Place: Use a central configuration file (e.g., config.yml or .env) to manage API keys, news feeds, time delays, database credentials, and other system settings.

10. Reliability

Retry on Failure: Ensure that any failures during API calls (either AI or posting to social media) trigger a retry mechanism to maintain continuous operation.

Monitoring: Implement some monitoring or alerting system that can notify you if any critical part of the process fails or experiences high latency.
